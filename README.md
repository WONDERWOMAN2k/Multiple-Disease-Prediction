# Multiple-Disease-Prediction
To assist medical practitioners and patients in early diagnosis of critical health conditions using AI-powered predictions, thus reducing health risks and improving treatment effectiveness.
# 🧠 Multiple Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases — **Kidney Disease, Liver Disease, and Parkinson's Disease** — using Machine Learning models.

## 🔍 Features

- Upload or input medical parameters to get predictions
- Visualizes important features influencing the prediction
- Includes trained models using Random Forest for each disease
- Clean and interactive UI with Streamlit

## 🧪 Datasets Used

- **Kidney Disease Dataset** (Target column: `classification`)
- **Liver Disease Dataset** (Target column: `Dataset`)
- **Parkinson’s Disease Dataset** (Target column: `status`)

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WONDERWOMAN2k/Multiple-Disease-Prediction.git
